This repository contains a basic analysis of 2020 election data as reported by the New York Times.

Here's how it works
1. Download all of the NYT's vote data from their API endpoint.
1. Convert NYT's time series data into discrete changes in vote totals.
1. Look at the changes to detect any anomalies in behavior.

The source data downloaded fom NYT is here: [data/input](data/input).

The processed output is here [data/output](data/output).  You can also look at it on Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ez2bupWlmf7V-nE17ScjQzm-Y_Cyi1qjT9ZO9hDDOC4/edit?usp=sharing).
